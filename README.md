Howe Sound Wind Map
Jonah Golden, 2015-11-08

10-Minute Plan: This plan is meant to give readers and contributors a general layout of
the code and documents contained within this project. 

The overarching goal of the code contained within this project is to make a 2-dimensional 
wind map of Howe Sound, British Columbia.  This map will be used by the wind surfing 
community and potentially others.
  
The planning directory contains an original project proposal as well as a notes.txt file
that should be added to whenever contributors make changes or additions to the project.

Necessary steps towards achieving this goal are contained in different scripts, within 
the src directory.  These include visualizing background information of wind data at Howe 
Sound, loading a basemap of the region, plotting contour lines over this basemap, and 
eventually plotting wind vectors and wind barbs.  

The necessary data for running these scripts will be contained within the data directory
of this project.  This data includes historical wind data for Howe Sound, a map 
of the region, elevation data of the region, and live wind data for Howe Sound.

Any plots or tables that come from analysis will be contained in the results directory.

Final manuscripts and the final wind map can be found in the doc directory.
